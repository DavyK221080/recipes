Ingredients:

8 ounces (225g) of spaghetti noodles
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 can (14.5 ounces) of diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon garlic
Salt and pepper to taste
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)
Instructions:

Cook Spaghetti: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain the noodles and set aside.

Prepare Sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion, and saut√© until softened and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

Add Tomatoes and Seasoning: Pour the diced tomatoes into the skillet with the garlic and onion. Stir in the dried oregano and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.

Combine Sauce and Spaghetti: Add the cooked spaghetti noodles to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss well to coat the noodles evenly with the sauce. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

Serve: Remove the skillet from the heat. Serve the spaghetti hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley if desired.
